Navigate

- Click on the app name on https://zehairawans-team.monday.com/apps/manage

Nice to have

- Find a better way to update build without releasing new version, maybe use netlify or maybe look at the official doc

- board is https://zehairawans-team.monday.com/ because it's dev account, the regular is expired

Below board name

- on plus sign => apps => boardview
